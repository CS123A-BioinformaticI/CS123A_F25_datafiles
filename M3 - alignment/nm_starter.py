"""
Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment (starting template)

Your task is to complete the implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
for global sequence alignment. The algorithm should take two DNA sequences
and align them using dynamic programming.

Scoring scheme:
- Match: +1
- Mismatch: -1
- Gap: -2
